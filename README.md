# risk_aversion_study
This program calculates r(RP3) according to tab-separated data from "dond_data_with_briefcase.txt"
and finds individual averages for r.

see Chen and John 2021 (Decision Heuristics and Descriptive Choice Models for Sequential High-Stakes Risky Choices in the Deal or No Deal Game).

In their Ratio-RP3 model, r = banker's offer/(sum of briefcases * proportion of cases greater than banker's offer)
r is used as a measure for an individual's risk tolerance.
